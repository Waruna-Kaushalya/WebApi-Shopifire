# Introduction

## How we selected the domain

The following factors were considered when selecting our domain for the project. The characteristics of the selected product should be minimal. Because if we choose a product that has many characteristics, we should put more effort into designing a shopping cart. So we have chosen fruit as a domain.

## Application flow

Firstly, The user should be registered to the application. Then he can add the items to the cart. Then he can change the quantity of the product he added to the cart. Also, he can remove the selected product if he doesn't want it. He also has the option to search the product by using the search bar.

And admin can add, remove, and update the product. Also, admin can remove registered users. Also, registered users can view their profile. And update his information as he or she wants.
